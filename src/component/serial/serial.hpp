    serial.hpp: Serial I/O

    This is a very basic connectionless implementation of a single serial line; it doe snot know anything about baud rate, data framing or any other 
    chip behaviour which would be specific to a UART. This just bitbangs the raw data to a queue which can be read by some otehr component.
